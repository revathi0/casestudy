    A symbolic is an actual link to the original file, whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file.
    If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value, because it points to a non-existent file.
    But in the case of hard link, it is entirely opposite. Even if you delete the original file, 
    the hard link will still has the data of the original file. Because hard link acts as a mirror copy of the original file.

Sort the file based on the filename descending order (last field)
	ls | sort -r

Sort the file based only on the inode count
	ls -li | sort -n

Sort the file based on the user name and group name in reverse order
	ls -lr | sort -k 3
	ls -lr | sort -k 4

Sort the file based on the file size and store the output in a file called sortedfile
	ls -laS >sortedfile
	cat sortedfile
